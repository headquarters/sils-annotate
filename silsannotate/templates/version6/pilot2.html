        <h1>To Grow in Wisdom: Vannevar Bush, Information Overload, and the Life of Leisure </h1>
        <p>David M. Levy </p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p> It has been nearly sixty years since Vannevar Bush’s essay, “As We May Think,” was first published in The Atlantic Monthly, an article that foreshadowed and possibly invented hypertext. While much has been written about this seminal piece, little has been said about the argument Bush presented to justify the creation of the memex, his proposed personal information device. This paper revisits the article in light of current technological and social trends. It notes that Bush’s argument centered around the problem of information overload and observes that in the intervening years, despite massive technological innovation, the problem has only become more extreme. It goes on to argue that today’s manifestation of information overload will require not just better management of information but the creation of space and time for thinking and reflection, an objective that is consonant with Bush’s original aims.</p>

        <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>It has been nearly sixty years since Vannevar Bush’s essay, “As We May Think” <a href = "#ref3"> [3] </a>, was first published in The Atlantic Monthly<a href = "#note1"> 1 </a>. Today the article is recognized as a seminal work, one that foreshadowed, and possibly invented, hypertext, and that laid the groundwork for the field of information science. Over the last ten or so years, there have been at least two major efforts to reflect on the article’s influence on high technology: the collection From Memex to Hypertext edited by Nyce and Kahn <a href = "#ref9"> [9] </a>, which grew out of the 1987 Hypertext Conference, and the Vannevar Bush Symposium held at MIT on October 12-13, 1995 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the paper’s publication<a href = "#note2"> 2 </a>. In addition, the paper has been cited many hundreds of times in various technical literatures.<a href = "#note3"> 3 </a> Together, this stream of reflections and references constitutes a fitting tribute to an extraordinarily important and influential piece of work.</p>
        <p>So much has been written that there would seem to be little more to say. Thanks to a detailed biography of Bush by G. Pascal
        Zachary <a href = "#ref14"> [14] </a> and reflections in the Nyce-Kahn volume, we now know a great deal about the circumstances in which Bush wrote the piece. Thanks to careful attention to the central section of the paper, we understand how the memex – Bush’s proposed personal information device – might have looked and operated. And thanks to the reflections of various practitioners in the computer and information sciences, we can trace the influence of Bush’s ideas on real people and systems.
        </p>
        <p>What has received considerably less attention, however, is the way Bush framed his proposal. For the essay isn’t simply an exercise in envisioning possible future technologies and systems; it is an argument for these technologies and systems. What exactly, though, was the nature of this argument? What was Bush hoping to achieve by proposing the memex? And to what extent has the vast, global, digital experiment to which his proposal contributed succeeded in achieving the ends he identified? It is the aim of this paper to re-read and analyze the Atlantic Monthly article in light of current technological and social trends. In this sense it is meant as a contribution to our historical understanding. But at the same time, it is hoped that the perspective this analysis provides can contribute to ongoing and future technological developments, including the current focus on cyberinfrastructure and education.</p>
        <p>The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides some historical background on Vannevar Bush’s life and work and lays out his argument for the memex – his hope that the memex would solve the problem of information overload. Section 3 discusses the immediate historical background for the problem of information overload – the “library problem” or “information problem,” as it was then called – and considers why this problem still hasn’t been solved sixty years later. Section 4 provides a different approach to the problem, as detailed by a contemporary of Bush, a German philosopher named Josef Pieper. Pieper argued that the reflective or contemplative dimension of human experience – which he called “leisure” – was being lost and needed to be recovered. Section 5 further elaborates on this argument and considers how Bush might have felt about it. The final section frames the argument as an “environmental” issue and concludes with some implications for future social and technological development.</p>

        <h2>2. AS WE MAY THINK</h2>
        <p>Vannevar Bush was trained as an electrical engineer. He received his Ph.D. at MIT, taught there, and in 1931 became its vice president as well as the dean of its School of Engineering. His greatest technical contributions came in the area of analog computing. But Bush mainly made his mark on the world not as a working engineer or as a teacher but as a skilled administrator and political operator: he was arguably the first American technocrat. In 1940, with America’s entry into the war on the horizon, Bush approached President Roosevelt with a proposal: to create an organization through which American scientists could develop new weapon systems and other critical technologies that would give the Allies the edge over the Axis powers. Roosevelt approved the plan – first called the National Defense Research Committee, and later the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) – and Bush oversaw an extensive network of academic scientists who collaborated with military and corporate partners. Bush was deeply involved in Roosevelt’s decision to authorize the creation of the first atomic bomb. And based on his wartime successes as a research administrator, he was one of the first to imagine a peacetime successor to OSRD, which became the National Science Foundation. During these intensely productive years, Bush was famous enough to appear on the cover of the April 3, 1944 issue of Time magazine.</p>
        <p>This is a stunning record of achievement, yet today Bush is probably best remembered, especially within the computer and information sciences, for the essay he published in the July 1945 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. At the heart of the article is his proposal for the memex, a device that would allow researchers to read materials stored in microfilm format and to create associative indexes, “the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another” (p. 103). But in addition to imagining, and possibly inventing, hypertext, Bush proposed highly compact storage, head-mounted compact micro-cameras, and voice input devices.</p>
        <p>Bush’s paper is known to have excited and motivated other researchers, including Douglas Englebart, Ted Nelson, and Alan
        Kay, who went on to develop computational tools in the spirit of what Bush first imagined. Although these subsequent inventions were realized by different technological means than Bush first foresaw, it seems fair to say that much of what he proposed has come to pass. Storage today is even more compact than Bush imagined. Head-mounted cameras, and even more radical forms of “wearable computing,” now exist. The personal computer, which might be considered a more powerful realization of the memex, is everywhere. And the World Wide Web has made hypertext as ordinary as the television or the telephone.
        </p>
        <p>Bush has been justifiably celebrated, even venerated, for the influence he exerted on future generations of technologists. The central section of “As We May Think,” in which he develops his idea of the memex is almost certainly the most studied and best known section of the paper. What has received less attention is just how Bush frames his proposal, specifically the reasons he gives for creating the memex. In eight paragraphs at the beginning and two paragraphs at the end, Bush lays out a clear and powerful argument, which might be paraphrased as follows:</p>
        <p>A devastating period is now coming to an end, a terrible war in which science and technology have enabled people to deploy “cruel weapons” against one another. The survival of the human race depends on its ability to transcend such behavior and to “grow in the wisdom of race experience.” Such wisdom may perhaps be had by better use of the record of human achievement, for if people have better access to the record, they would be able to “better review [their] shady past and analyze more completely and objectively [their] present problems.” But there are obstacles today preventing people from making the best use of the record: they are bogged down by the amount of information, the difficulty in accessing it, and its increasingly specialized nature.<a href = "#note4"> 4 </a> As the war comes to an end, therefore, scientists, whose energies have been concentrated on aiding the war effort, should now devote themselves to more peaceful ends. If they were to focus on developing technologies that removed these information obstacles (being bogged down by the amount and inaccessibility of specialized knowledge), they would make a major contribution to human survival and flourishing.</p>
        <p>It was through this argument that Bush attempted to justify the development of the memex. The future tools he hoped to see were those that would reduce information overload <a href = "#note1"> 5 </a> and promote information synthesis, tools that would allow humanity “truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience.” And on a note of cautious optimism he concluded: man “may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome” (p. 107).</p>

        <h2>3. THE LIBRARY PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>It might be useful to put Bush’s concern with information overload in some further historical perspective. Bush first began formulating his proposal for the memex in the 1930s. By this time, the management of scientific information had already been recognized as a widespread and largely unsolved problem. By the end of World War I, according to Colin Burke, “improvements in printing, communications and transportation [had] created a bundle of opportunities and frustrations that . . . began to be called the ‘library’ problem” (<a href = "#ref2"> [2] </a>, p. 99). This problem manifested itself differently to different constituencies. For the general public, the issue was unequal access to books and the cost of library materials. For scientists, it was “the inability of the traditional library to serve its most important client, the scientific researcher” (<a href = "#ref2"> [2] </a>, p. 100). By the end of World War I “scientists were voicing their frustrations and sought to establish . . . an information system for science” (<a href = "#ref2"> [2] </a>, p. 110). Such a system would be outside the jurisdiction of librarians.</p>
        <p>Bush’s proposal in “As We May Think” can be seen as his attempt to address the library problem – which later came to be called “the information problem” – by attending to the information needs of scientists and other researchers. “Bush wanted a fundamental reform of the library,” Burke says, “to make it conform to the concepts of the new scientist and engineers. He looked forward to the time when machines would allow practicing scientists to take charge of, if not to bypass, the library” (<a href = "#ref2"> [2] </a>, p. 119).<a href = "#note6"> 6 </a></p>
        <p>Sixty years after Bush published his proposal, huge technical strides have been made. Networked computers and globally accessible hypertext in many ways exceed anything that Bush proposed or imagined. Yet it is hard to deny that the specific problems he wanted to address, information overload and specialization, have not been solved. The specialization of disciplines has, if anything, increased, and along with it the difficulty of bridging across disciplines. Scholars continue to feel bogged down by the quantity and variety of the literature. Not only is the scientific and scholarly record immense and growing rapidly, so too is the record in many other spheres of human endeavor. In their 2003 report, Varian and Lyman estimate “that the amount of new information stored on paper, film, magnetic, and optical media has about doubled in the last three years” <a href = "#ref8"> [8] </a>, i.e. between 1999 and 2002. On the face of it, the development of personal digital information systems and global hypertext seems not to have solved the problem Bush identified but to have exacerbated it. What happened?</p>
        <p>One obvious answer is that digital tools have enabled the creation and distribution of information on a vast scale never before imaginable. Bush never foresaw that the technologies he hoped would tame the problem might actually contribute to its intensification. But it could be argued that the sheer amount of information in the world isn’t in and of itself the problem. Rather, it is the difficulty in gaining access to and managing what is most relevant. And here, it is clear that digital tools haven’t kept pace with the rate of expansion.</p>
        <p>But it is possible, and even likely, that superior techniques and technologies will ultimately make the tasks of information access, synthesis and management immeasurably easier than they are today. Yet such a welcome state of affairs still won’t necessarily signal the successful resolution Bush was seeking. For as Bush himself pointed out, the information problem isn’t just the state of the record (its quantity, volume, or state of organization) but the possibility of using it. “A record, if it is to be useful to science,” he said, “must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted” (p. 90). While this observation seems exactly right, it doesn’t go far enough. Yes, consulting the record is essential, but we must also have time to reflect on what is gleaned from it. But today we are undergoing a huge speedup in our work and home lives; one of the sad casualties is time to think and reflect. More of the record is broadly available to us than ever before, but there is less time to make use of it – and specifically to make use of it with any depth of reflection.</p>

        <h2>4. THE PROBLEM OF LEISURE</h2>
        <p>As it happens, at the same time that Bush’s article appeared, another thinker was expressing concern over the loss of reflective and contemplative time. He too was considering how society should proceed in the aftermath of the war, albeit from a very different vantage point. But whereas Bush was an engineer and a technocrat, Josef Pieper was a philosopher. And while Bush was writing from the perspective of the victor, the German Pieper was writing as a member of a vanquished nation just beginning to address the problems of economic and social reconstruction. Both, however, were concerned with the challenge of making the transition to a more peaceful and prosperous world. Each identified a problem, and although not exactly the same problem, they bear a sufficient resemblance to suggest that these two men were seeing some of the same phenomena, if not proposing the same solution. </p>
        <p>In 1948, three years after Bush’s article appeared, Pieper published a small volume in German called Musse und Kult. (The book appeared in English in 1952 with the title, Leisure: The Basis of Culture <a href = "#ref10"> [10] </a>, and was recently republished, in 1998, in a much improved translation <a href = "#ref11"> [11] </a>.) What should Germany be doing in the immediate aftermath of the war? Pieper asks. Clearly, it needs to put its house in order, structurally and economically. But it equally needs to put its “entire moral and intellectual heritage” back in order. And he worries that an overemphasis on economic development, to the exclusion of other human concerns, will prevent the new German republic from recovering its deeper, lifegiving roots in Western culture.</p>
        <p>For Germany, Pieper claims, is in danger of creating a world of “total work.” “[T]he world of work is becoming our entire world,” he says; “it threatens to engulf us completely, and the demands of the world of work become greater and greater, till at last they make a ‘total’ claim upon the whole of human nature.” Something is surely out of balance. What has become of the idea of leisure? he asks. Leisure is a crucial dimension of human life, and we are in danger of losing it.</p>
        <p>With these remarks, Pieper appears to be worrying that people are in danger of working themselves into a workaholic frenzy and at risk of losing their weekends, vacation and recreation time; that they need and deserve more time off, more breaks, more free time. It would be natural to understand him in this way because the word “leisure” now means “freedom from time-consuming duties, responsibilities, or activities” <a href = "#ref1"> [1] </a>. But to understand Pieper as saying only this would be to miss the full import of his argument, which relies on the ancient Greek notion of leisure.</p>
        <p>For the Greeks, leisure was the highest good, the ultimate aim of human life, and work was a lesser, though still necessary, form of activity. This prioritization was directly reflected in their language: their only word for work could be translated literally as “not-leisure.” Work was what needed to be done for the sake of something else: spinning wool in order to make clothing, lighting a fire in order to keep warm, building a house in order to be sheltered from the elements. Leisure, by contrast, was that which required no justification beyond itself; philosophy, the arts, and the celebration of festivals fell under this category for the Greeks because they were simply an expression of the human spirit and its true life in the world. It is from this distinction that the modern notion of the “liberal arts” is derived; the liberal arts are those free of any need to justify themselves in terms of utility.</p>
        <p>Pieper clearly realized that this reversal of priorities might seem shocking to his postwar audience, that it might well appear to be a celebration of laziness and idleness. So he invokes Thomas Aquinas to argue that leisure, rightly understood and practiced, is hardly idleness; on the contrary, it is frenetic overwork that constitutes a form of idleness, and it is overwork – or “the restlessness of a self-destructive work-fanaticism” (<a href = "#ref11"> [11] </a>, p. 27), as he so dramatically puts it – that is the true moral lapse. Here Pieper wants to understand idleness not as dawdling or slacking off in the modern sense, as simply lazily lying about, but rather, following the medieval scholastics, as a failure to engage fully and responsibly with oneself and the world. In this older understanding, idleness – or acedia, to use a now largely forgotten word – meant “that the human being had given up on the very responsibility that comes with his dignity: . . . that he does not want to be what he really, and in the ultimate sense, is” (<a href = "#ref11"> [11] </a>, p. 28).
        </p>
        <p>Idleness or acedia, in this understanding, is a disengagement from reality. Leisure, by contrast, is an openness to reality, to things as they are, rather than as we wish them to be. Leisure “is a form of stillness,” Pieper explains, “that is the necessary preparation for accepting reality; only the person who is still can hear, and whoever is not still cannot hear. Such stillness as this is not mere soundlessness or a dead muteness. . . . Leisure is the disposition of receptive understanding, of contemplative beholding, and immersion in the real” (<a href = "#ref11"> [11] </a>, p. 31). Looking at a world engaged in postwar reconstruction, Pieper could see how the obsessive drive to work ever faster and harder might rob people of their humanity, their responsibility to family and community – how harried and driven workers might be distracted and absent.</p>

        <h2>5. TIME TO THINK</h2>
        <p>Coming out of the war, Pieper anticipated a world of too much work, and of a kind of work that would distance us from our deepest sources of wisdom and inspiration. At roughly the same time, Bush anticipated a world of too much information, and he proposed a technical solution that he hoped would allow the human race to grow in wisdom. Whatever good may have come from Bush’s essay – and it is considerable – his ideas do seem to have played into the scenario Pieper feared. Our new tools enable us to work longer and harder, and more so than at any time since</p>
        <p>Pieper’s book appeared, we are in a position to understand the restless and destructive side of work-fanaticism.
        Pieper sheds further light on the problem when he applies his understanding of work and leisure to the nature of human thinking. The medieval scholastics, he notes, recognized two modes of thinking, which they called ratio and intellectus. Ratio, says Pieper, “is the power of discursive thought, of searching and re-searching, abstracting, refining, and concluding, whereas
        intellectus refers to the ability of ‘simply looking,’ to which the truth presents itself as a landscape presents itself to the eye” (<a href = "#ref11"> [11] </a>, p. 11). The scholastics considered ratio to be a form of work, as much so as digging a ditch or building a house. Intellectus, however, was leisurely in the original Greek sense: quiet, contemplative, reflective. Thinking for the scholastics was inevitably a mixture of these two modes: hard, directed problemsolving combined with periods of apparent idleness.<a href = "#note7"> 7 </a>
        </p>
        <p>Thinking is also a central preoccupation for Bush – he did call his article “As We May Think,” after all. His hope was that by augmenting and perhaps automating the more repetitive aspects of the human thought process, people could be freed up to pursue thought’s more creative aspects. The tools he envisioned, and those we have since created, are superb instruments for ratio – for searching and re-searching, abstracting, refining, and concluding. Indeed, they are probably the best tools for ratio the world has ever known. But in the process of creating them, have we failed to leave room for, let alone to acknowledge, intellectus? Where in our work life, and in our culture more generally, is there time and space to reflect and consider, to sit quietly and think?</p>
        <p>Bush, I believe, would have understood and largely supported this argument. He was a practical man, not a philosopher or a theologian, and he probably would have been dismissive of some of Pieper’s language, including phrases like “immersion in the real.” But he spoke about the need for leisure time and about the dangers posed by the loss of reflection. According to his biographer, G. Pascal Zachary, he jealously guarded his free time. “I think hobbies are necessary for anyone who is compelled to work under strain,” Bush said in 1951 (<a href = "#ref14"> [14] </a>, p. 139). While still an academic in the 1930s, he worried that university education was degenerating into the acquisition of shallow bits of information and “forgetting points.” (<a href = "#ref14"> [14] </a>, p. 68) “The student is hounded,” Bush observed in 1933. “His hours are crowded and closely scheduled; he has little time for reading or reflection, and he does little such. All but the exceptional students become automatons.” (<a href = "#ref14"> [14] </a>, p. 69) He worried that without time and the encouragement to reflect more broadly, students would not be able to acquire, or retain, a sense of the larger whole. (This was clearly one of the motives behind the invention of the memex: the desire to counteract the effects of specialization and blinkered thinking.)</p>
        <p>Yet during the 1940s there was a war to be won. Bush believed, and had good reason to believe, that the fate of the free world depended on whether or not his coalition of academic scientists, military men, and government bureaucrats could develop superior technologies for weapons and for code encryption and decryption. He saw his job as mobilizing civilian scientists (in Zachary’s words) “to apply their talents to military needs, [and to] discard their leisurely academic pace and rush pell-mell for the finish line” (<a href = "#ref14"> [14] </a>, p. 138). (Under conditions of such extreme urgency, it is perhaps all the more remarkable that Bush continued to prize and protect his free time.) Bush clearly saw the war as a necessary period of extreme mobilization. My guess is that he never imagined that the sense of urgency would carry on beyond the war, and he expected that scientists, at least in the academy, would return to their much cherished and more leisurely pursuit of truth. In the sixty years since the war ended, however, the sense of urgency has not only continued but increased. A world of “total work” seems closer than ever. And, to a large extent, the kinds of tools that Bush hoped would free people up for reflection are being used in ways that diminish that possibility.</p>

        <h2>6. CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>For the scientists who identified the library problem in the early twentieth century, the solution seemed clear enough: to provide better technical means to access the record outside the jurisdiction of traditional librarians. An “information system for science” would address those library roles and practices they considered central to their work that weren’t being adequately handled by traditional libraries. They focused on the management of collections. But libraries then played (and continue to play) another vital role: providing an environment conducive to thought and reflection. Reading rooms in libraries, through architecture, furnishings, and policy, provided much needed spaces for quiet contemplation. In the early twentieth century, however, there was no apparent reason to define the library problem to include this concern within its scope.</p>
        <p>But today the library problem encompasses more. It isn’t simply about the amount of information, or about organizing and finding the most relevant information, although these are surely important concerns. There is an additional dimension to the problem: time – to think, to reflect, to absorb, to muse. I have come to think of these concerns by analogy with the environmental movement, which was born in the 1960s with the growing realization that unchecked urbanization and industrialization were destroying the earth’s precious natural balance. The publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962 <a href = "#ref6"> [6] </a> and the institution of the first Earth Day in 1970 were early steps in a global process of consciousness-raising. Over the past forty or so years, we have witnessed a huge investment of human energy directed at research, public discussion, policy-setting, and education. We now understand that the health of the planet requires the cultivation and protection of old growth forests, marshlands, and the like. Elementary school children regularly study their local ecosystem and take steps to restore it. Decades of study and intervention have affected the way huge numbers of people think about the planet.</p>
        <p>We are, it seems likely, at the beginning of an analogous movement, which might be called information environmentalism.
        Bombarded by e-mail and cell phone chatter, as well as the 24/7 onslaught of media news, entertainment, and advertisements, there is a growing recognition that some forms of information, such as spam, are pollutants. And it has become increasingly clear that with information, just as with food or other essential dimensions of life, we can have too much of good thing.<a href = "#note8"> 8 </a> But if the analogy to environmentalism is useful, it should lead us to ask: What are the informational equivalents of marshlands and old growth forests? What kinds of habitats and modes of being do we need to cultivate and protect as a counterbalance to the 24/7 barrage? How do we make room, in space and time, for reflection and contemplation?<a href = "#note9"> 9 </a>
        </p>
        <p>This line of thinking raises questions for technologists and for the digital library community. Should we now turn our attention to this problem, and if so, how? Does the traditional library’s provision of quiet reading rooms and spaces offer any guidance?
        Are there other models in our culture, either current or prior, that might help us think this through? To what extent is it a matter of providing sanctuary from cyberspace and to what extent can we envision creating sanctuaries – spaces for reflection, for intellectus – in cyberspace? These are pressing questions not just for digital libraries but for cyberinfrastructure and education in general. Bush worried as far back as the 1930s about the loss of reflective time in education. How much more concerned would he be now, when current technological developments seem only to have intensified the problem, not just among students but among faculty and the public at large? Surely something must be done if we are to promote the growth of wisdom that was Vannevar Bush’s ultimate aim.

        <p id="note4">4 Bush expressed it this way: “There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers – conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial” (pp. 88-89). </p>
        <p id="note5">5 Bush doesn’t use the phrase “information overload.” A brief inspection of various publication databases suggests that the phrase began to be used with some regularity in the 1980s; the first use found is from 1977.</p>
        <p id="note6">6 The word “library” appears four times in his article, principally to refer to the collection a user of the memex could have access to. For example:
        “Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library” (p. 102); “Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf” (p. 103).
        </p>
        <p id="note7">7 A contemporary philosopher, David Loy, argues that scientific creativity depends on the successful blending of these two modes of thought.
        “Rigorous logical thinking is necessary but not sufficient here; something extra is needed that cannot be derived mechanically” (<a href = "#ref7"> [7] </a>, p.158). He cites various examples, including the mathematician Poincaré reaching a roadblock in trying to solve a problem in “Fuchsian functions,” only to have the answer come to him while walking by the ocean. Most of us, I suspect, have experienced times when important thoughts have welled up from our depths at apparently idle moments.
        </p>
        <p id="note8">8 Herbert Simon, Nobel-prize winner in economics and early researcher in artificial intelligence, made this point more than twenty-five years ago when he observed: “In a world where information is relatively scarce and where problems for decision are few and simple, information is always a positive good. In a world where attention is a major scarce resource, information may be an expensive luxury, for it may turn our attention from what is important to what is unimportant. We cannot afford to attend to information simply because it is there” (<a href = "#ref12"> [12] </a>, p. 13).</p>
