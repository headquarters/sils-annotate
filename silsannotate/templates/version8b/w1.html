        <br>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>The first, and most important, step in conducting a research study is to define your research question. Having a clear statement of your research question in hand allows you to design your study (including your overall strategy and your specific data collection procedures). It guides your selection of a sample for the study, your selection of a research design, your approach to data collection, and how you will analyze your data. A clear statement of your research question will also help you justify the costs of conducting the research, to external funding sources or to yourself (<a href="#21" class = "reference">Maxwell, 2005</a>). In addition, a clear statement of your research question will help you to stay focused through the study's completion.</p>

        <p>But let's start back at the beginning. Where would an idea for a research question come from? There are two general ways in which research questions originate. First, your research question may come from your own experience or direct observation of some situation or event, through discussion with your colleagues, or through exposure to current topics in the field (<a href="#12" class = "reference">Gray, 2004</a>; <a href="#18" class = "reference">Locke et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#26" class = "reference">Robson, 2002</a>). In other words, a situation you encounter in information and library science (ILS) practice presents a problem that you're interested in solving. For example, you may wonder whether college students would learn searching skills if they were taught by their discipline's faculty, rather than the library faculty (example adapted from <a href="#9" class = "reference">Eldredge, 2001</a>). A second source of research questions is the logical gaps that exist in our current state of knowledge of the field (<a href="#18" class = "reference">Locke et al., 2007</a>). There may be a recent study that provides some new information about how students interact with online resources, but it didn't investigate such interactions by faculty. There may be a theory that has been proposed, but you're not sure of whether it can explain what's happening in a new situation. Usually, these ideas come from reading or browsing the literature, conversations with colleagues, and your own reflections on your knowledge of the field (<a href="#18" class = "reference">Locke et al., 2007</a>). Whichever of these two avenues leads you to your research question(s), the most important consideration is that you're personally interested in and motivated to answer the question(s).</p>

        <p>The process of developing a research question begins with clarifying what problem you are trying to solve. Your primary task at this point is to clarify the meanings of the concepts involved in the problem (<a href="#25" class = "reference">Punch, 1998</a>). A good understanding of the problem, as experienced in practice or encountered in prior research/theory, will lead to the research question, defined as "a statement of what you wish to know about some unsatisfactory situation" (<a href="#18" class = "reference">Locke et al., 2007, p. 45</a>). In addition, you will want to clarify the purposes or goals of the study – your motivations or intentions for undertaking the study (<a href="#18" class = "reference">Locke et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#21" class = "reference">Maxwell, 2005</a>). This chapter will guide you in the development of your research question(s).</p>

        <h2>UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO ASK</h2>
        <p>Once you are able to state your research question, you need to unpack it a bit (<a href="#24" class = "reference">O'Leary, 2005</a>). Begin by exploring your personal perspectives on the question. Do you have any direct experiences that are related to the question? If so, how will they affect your plans for the study? Next, you should consider the perspectives of other stakeholders. Stakeholders include anyone who has a vested interest in the outcomes of your research. These might include the users of an information system or library, managers or employees within a particular organization, trustees or advisors to an organization, and corporations (including vendors) that have a commercial interest in the study, among others. Which of these stakeholders will be supportive of your research, and which may try to block the study? Viewed from the perspective of a particular stakeholder, you may want to revise your question to take into account a relevant idea that you had not previously considered. Finally, you will want to consider the cultural context of your research question, including the prevailing worldview that may have shaped it. Are you making assumptions that are consistent with that worldview but may not be accurate? Does your question reflect the interests of the dominant groups in society and ignore the interests of marginalized groups? Through this unpacking process, you can strengthen and solidify your understanding of your question.</p>

        <p>All research ideas occur within an intellectual context. Whether your idea originated in your own experience, in conversations with colleagues, or through your reading of the literature, you will need to begin the process of defining your research question by reading some more (<a href="#24" class = "reference">O'Leary, 2005</a>). You need to be sure that the question's answer hasn't already been discovered by someone else. You need to know what other people have found about the same phenomenon in other settings. You need to know what other people have found about related phenomena in settings that are similar to yours. You need to understand how your research will be relevant and important to the field. You need to identify any theories or models that could help you conceptualize your research question. You need to know which methods other researchers have used to investigate the phenomenon in which you're interested. To identify the readings you need, you will want to gather recommendations from colleagues, conduct literature searches (including citation searches), and check the footnotes or references on the important articles you read. With the knowledge you gain, you will be in a better position to clearly state the question you want to answer.</p>

        <p>As you consider alternative research questions, there are four important matters to consider. The first is that a question isn't really a question unless there is some uncertainty about the answer (<a href="#3" class = "reference">Booth, 2006</a>; <a href="#26" class = "reference">Robson, 2002</a>). For example, you might be interested in whether a three-session information literacy course will improve the academic work of first-year college students. As you read the literature, you find a number of studies of this question or closely related questions. If you find that these studies, across multiple settings and providing multiple types of instruction, consistently conclude that there is little or no effect on students' academic achievement, you will not want to conduct a study of the same question that has been investigated in the past. However, if you find that these studies have mixed results, you will need to delve deeper, to find out which types of programs were successful in which settings. Within those contexts that are similar to yours, there may or may not be consensus among the studies' findings. On the basis of what you find in past studies, you will want to define a research question that has not yet been answered.</p>

        <p>The second important matter to consider is the importance of the question. <a href="#18" class = "reference">Locke et al. (2007)</a> suggest asking yourself, "What don't we know that matters?" (p. 44). In the first part of their question, they're raising the issue we just discussed; in the second part, they're raising the issue of the importance of your question, that is, the impact that finding the answer will have. Will the results have an impact on practice? Will they have an impact on our general knowledge of the field, leading to development of improved or new theories? The amount of effort to be invested in the study should be in balance with the level of the contribution that will be made by its findings (<a href="#19" class = "reference">Losee & Worley, 1993</a>).</p>

        <p>A third matter to consider is what <a href="#11" class = "reference">Gill and Johnson (1997)</a> call the symmetry of potential outcomes (p. 17). What they mean is that no matter whether you confirm or refute your initial hypotheses, the findings of the study will be useful. For example, if you're studying the relative effectiveness of two styles of library reference interviews, you would like to know which of the two is more effective. Even if there is no difference between the two styles of interview, the results will be useful because then you can use other criteria to select a style, or you can adopt both styles as acceptable for use within your library. So, as you consider alternative research questions, take into account what will happen if you don't get the results for which you hope.</p>

        <p>The fourth matter to consider at this point is the feasibility of answering the question in which you're interested (<a href="#22" class = "reference">Miles & Huberman, 1984</a>; <a href="#26" class = "reference">Robson, 2002</a>). As <a href="#1" class = "reference">Barrett (2006)</a> notes, a question must not only be "interesting, important, or useful"; it must also lead to a study that is "realistic and feasible" (p. 27) to conduct. It's very possible to develop a research question that cannot be answered, given the resources available to you. In most cases, you will address this issue by constraining the scope of your question(s). Keeping all these considerations in mind, you're now ready to write your problem statement.</p>

        <h2>WRITING A PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>While <a href="#14" class = "reference">Hernon (2001)</a> delineates several components of a problem statement (including a lead-in, a claim for originality based on a literature review, and a justification of the study's value), we will focus on making the research question(s) explicit. This is an iterative process; as you draft a research question, you will identify ambiguities in it or find that it's too broad or too narrow. Each iteration will make it clearer and more useful in completing your "research journey" (<a href="#24" class = "reference">O'Leary, 2005, p. 32</a>).</p>

        <p>A research question is situated within a conceptual framework: the system of concepts to be studied as well as the relationships between them (<a href="#22" class = "reference">Miles & Huberman, 1984</a>; <a href="#21" class = "reference">Maxwell, 2005</a>). It can be represented either graphically (e.g., as a concept map) or in narrative form. It also makes explicit the researcher's "assumptions, expectations, beliefs and theories" about the phenomenon under study (<a href="#21" class = "reference">Maxwell, 2005, p. 33</a>). While you may be relying heavily on a preexisting theory or model, keep in mind that your conceptual framework will be constructed or synthesized based on your integration of ideas from other researchers and your own reflections on current knowledge in the field. Because it provides the context for your specific research questions, a well formulated conceptual framework can both focus the research question and bound its scope. A good example of applying such a conceptual framework in formulating a research question is discussed in the chapter on testing hypotheses: <a href="#34" class = "reference">Sundar et al.'s (2007)</a> study of the effects of peripheral cues on people's evaluations of newsbot displays. It would have been easy for the authors to pose their research question, ignoring the underlying concepts that framed their work. For example, they could have posed the question as a straightforward study of the usability of news bot displays of various kinds. Instead, they firmly embedded their work within the context of earlier work on the types of cues that affect people's interactions with information, integrating concepts from two different theories about those interactions. While not all studies need to have such a strong theoretical foundation, those that do will provide results that have more far-reaching impact than those that are not situated within a clear conceptual framework.</p>

        <p>On the basis of the conceptual framework, you will identify one or more research questions that are of particular interest. They will focus the attention of your study on the most important aspects of the conceptual framework (<a href="#8" class = "reference">Creswell, 2003</a>; <a href="#22" class = "reference">Miles & Huberman, 1984</a>; <a href="#26" class = "reference">Robson, 2002</a>). A particular research question may be important because its answer has the potential to change particular practices in ILS or because it helps us to more fully understand a crucial aspect of people's information behaviors or the information systems with which they interact. Making your research question(s) explicit allows you "to get clear about what, in the general domain, is of most interest" (<a href="#22" class = "reference">Miles & Huberman, 1984, p. 35</a>). <a href="#33" class = "reference">Stone (2002)</a> reinforces this point when he argues that "formulating the research question ... acts as a guard against sloppy thinking" (p. 265).</p>

        <p>Several authors have provided sound advice about how to state your research question(s), and all of them begin by saying that you need to write them down. You should be able to state each research question as a single sentence (<a href="#19" class = "reference">Losee & Worley, 1993</a>). If it is too broad, it will not provide sufficient guidance for developing your study design; if it is too narrow, you may be blinded to relevant data or alternative ways to achieve your research purposes (<a href="#21" class = "reference">Maxwell, 2005</a>). <a href="#3" class = "reference">Booth (2006)</a> recommends that you incorporate several components (setting, perspective, intervention, comparison, evaluation) in your research question. To illustrate this point, he provides an example question: "From the perspective of an undergraduate student (perspective) in a university library (setting), is provision of a short term loan collection (intervention) more effective than a general collection (comparison) in terms of the percentage availability of recommended texts (evaluation)?" (p. 363). You need to be able to define each concept or component of the question (<a href="#1" class = "reference">Barrett, 2006</a>). For instance, in Booth's (2006) example, you need to define what is meant by a short-term loan collection and a general collection. Your definitions should be clear enough that they can be used to design your study methods.</p>

        <p>In summary, a good research question has several attributes: (l) it is clear, unambiguous, and easily understood; (2) it is specific enough to suggest the data that need to be collected during your study; (3) it is answerable, in the sense that it is feasible to collect the needed data; (4) it is interconnected with important concepts or phenomena; and (5) it is substantively relevant to the field (<a href="#25" class = "reference">Punch, 1998</a>).</p>

        <h2>THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RESEARCH QUESTION FOR THE RESEARCH DESIGN</h2>
        <p>As <a href="#25" class = "reference">Punch (1998)</a> notes, "a well stated research question indicates what data will be necessary to answer it" (p. 46). While research into scientists' behavior has indicated that at least some researchers are ambivalent about the dominance of the research question over the research methods (<a href="#5" class = "reference">Bryman, 2007</a>), there is almost universal promotion of the idea that your research question will guide the development of your study methods. <a href="#2" class = "reference">Booth (2001)</a> provides several examples of the way in which the connection between the research question and the data needed to answer it will influence the design of the study. As you consider different methods for your study, you will want to select the approach that "has the most strengths and fewest weaknesses in the context of the problem statement and objectives" (<a href="#14" class = "reference">Hernon, 2001, p. 84</a>).</p>

        <p>While the preceding section encouraged the development of very precise research questions, there is actually a spectrum of approaches. At one end of this spectrum are the most precise research questions, often specified as hypotheses to be tested. This type of question would call for a tightly structured research design, resulting in data that are also well structured (<a href="#25" class = "reference">Punch, 1998</a>). <a href="#26" class = "reference">Robson (2002)</a> describes these research designs as fixed because all their components are determined in advance of the study being carried out. At the other end of the spectrum are research questions that are intended to provide general guidance to the research effort but that are more exploratory and open in their conception. Such questions call for research approaches that are more loosely structured and that will evolve as they proceed. The data collected are often open ended and less structured. <a href="#26" class = "reference">Robson (2002)</a> describes these research designs as flexible because they may be altered as the research progresses. <a href="#21" class = "reference">Maxwell (2005)</a> proposes an interactive approach to developing such designs, with the goals and research questions interacting with the selection of study methods during the course of the study; both the goals and questions and the methods are expected to change during the course of the study.</p>

        <p>The research question(s) you are asking have implications for several aspects of the study design. First, they have implications for the sample that will participate in the study. You will need to decide which people, organizations, settings, and so on, are of interest. This component of the study design is reflected in the perspective and setting components of the research question suggested by <a href="#3" class = "reference">Booth (2006)</a>. Second, the questions have implications for the data to be collected. As you define each of the concepts incorporated in your question, you will need to decide what data can be used as an indicator for each. <a href="#20" class = "reference">Mason (2002)</a> suggests that you ask yourself, "Which of my research questions does each method or data source help me to address?" (p. 27). In this way, you can tightly link your data collection efforts (including both which data will be collected and how they will be collected) to answering your research questions. Finally, the research questions have implications for your data analysis methods. You will want to use those analysis methods that will help you focus your attention on answering your research questions.</p>

        <h2>MAKING YOUR PROJECT HAPPEN</h2>
        <p>In this chapter, we've discussed how to develop your research questions and how they will be used to design your study. One of the criteria for a good research question is that it leads to a study that is feasible to complete. In this section, we will briefly discuss a few of the issues you will want to consider to ensure that your study design is feasible to carry out (<a href="#1" class = "reference">Barrett, 2006</a>). As <a href="#23" class = "reference">Moore (1987)</a> points out, it is "necessary to keep the scale of the research in tune with the size of the problem" (p. 3).</p>

        <p>The first issue to consider is your access to the people that you'd like to include as participants in your study. You will need to know how to identify and locate them. You will need to be able to convince a sample of them to participate in your study. You may need to retain their participation over a period of time, depending on your study design. You will need to make sure that they have the ability to complete the procedures required for data collection (e.g., you can't conduct a Web survey of people who don't have easy access to the Web).</p>

        <p>Second, you will need to consider the equipment and other material resources that may be needed to conduct your study. Your study procedures may involve specialized computer equipment or software (e.g., a way to capture people's interactions with a new information system). They may involve printing and mailing of surveys. They may involve audio or video recording of interviews. They may involve providing financial incentives to your study participants. In summary, you need to make sure you have the resources to obtain the equipment and materials you will need to carry out the study. In addition, you need to make sure that you or a member of your research team has the expertise to use specialized equipment or software effectively. </p>

        <p>Finally, you need to consider the political support you will need to carry out the study. Particularly if the study is to be carried out within the context of an organization, you will need the approval and support of the organization's management. You may also encounter resistance to your study among your potential participants if the research question is sensitive in some way. For example, if you are studying the ways in which a particular computer system can improve the efficiency of the workers using it, they may believe that the purpose of the study is to calculate how many workers can be laid off. In such a setting, you will face political obstacles in conducting the research.</p>

        <p>If you find that you do have access to your potential study participants, you have a means to obtain the equipment and materials needed, and you have the political support of the study's stakeholders, you are ready to proceed. Otherwise, you may need to rethink your research questions (<a href="#26" class = "reference">Robson, 2002</a>; <a href="#33" class = "reference">Stone, 2002</a>).</p>

        <h3>The Role of Funding Agencies in Shaping Your Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>In some cases, you do not have the resources to carry out a research study, but there is a funding source that might be convinced to support it. Both private sources (foundations and corporations) and public sources of funding (local, state, and federal government agencies) should be considered. Possible funding sources might be identified by searching specialized databases, by searching the Web, and by checking the acknowledgments in related articles discovered during your reading on the topic. Once you've identified a few possible funding sources, check what types of projects they've funded in the past. Also check any initiatives they've recently announced. If you have a research question that you think is important for the field, it's very possible that you can convince others of its importance.</p>

        <p>In some cases, you may also want to modify your research question somewhat to correspond more closely to a funding source's interests. For instance, a foundation may fund exactly the type of study you're interested in conducting, but they limit their support to studies in the state in which their offices are located. If such a compromise is still of interest to you, you may be persuaded by the funding source's views. In other cases, you will want to seek other sources of funding. Careful reflection on the significance of your research question will guide you in making this decision.</p>


        <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
        <p>In each chapter within this book, examples illustrate the way in which the chapter's topic has been applied in specific research studies. To illustrate the ways in which research questions are developed, I will instead briefly summarize the examples used in the rest of this section, with special emphasis on how each research question was developed. The examples are discussed more fully in the other chapters in which they are presented.</p>

        <p>Chapter 3 focuses on research questions that are grounded in information and library practice. Such research questions are motivated by specific problems that arise in the everyday lives of information professionals. Some of these studies are carried out by those professionals, while others are carried out by academic researchers (usually working closely with practicing professionals). The three examples discussed in this chapter include a study designed to help a branch library in a large university develop its marketing plan for a particular subset of its user population (<a href="#32" class = "reference">Song, 2006</a>), a study that uses the logs of user searches of a Web site to develop a menu structure for a portion of that Web site (<a href="#15" class = "reference">Huntington & Nicholas, 2006</a>), and a statewide study of school libraries and the ways in which they can help students learn (<a href="#35" class = "reference">Todd, 2003</a>).</p>

        <p>Chapter 4 focuses on descriptive studies: those that are intended to fully describe some phenomenon of interest. Descriptive studies address such questions as, What is this phenomenon? What occurred at this event, and who participated in it? When and where is the phenomenon occurring? How frequently is this phenomenon occurring? Or What is the meaning of this occurrence? The four examples discussed in this chapter include a study oflibrary users' understanding of relationships among sets of works (e.g., multiple versions of Dickens's <i><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol">A Christmas Carol</a></i>; <a href="#6" class = "reference">Carlyle, 2001</a>), a study of chemists' perceptions of e-prints (<a href="#4" class = "reference">Brown, 2003</a>), the role of reading in the lives of lesbian and queer young women (<a href="#27" class = "reference">Rothbauer, 2004a</a>, <a href="#28" class = "reference">2004b</a>), and a study of imposed queries brought to public libraries (<a href="#13" class = "reference">Gross & Saxton, 2001</a>). Because the phenomena of interest in ILS are changing rapidly, there is a strong need for high-quality descriptive studies.</p>

        <p>Testing specific hypotheses is the focus of Chapter 5. In some situations, we already have a basic understanding of a phenomenon and can begin to formulate hypotheses about the relationships between that phenomenon and other phenomena. Such is the case for the studies examined in this chapter: a study of people's desire for control of information retrieval interactions (<a href="#36" class = "reference">White & Ruthven, 2006</a>), a study of the effect of a workshop on clinicians' information seeking behaviors and attitudes (<a href="#7" class = "reference">Cheng, 2003</a>), and a study of the effects of peripheral cues on people's evaluations of newsbot displays (<a href="#34" class = "reference">Sundar et al., 2007</a>). As you can see, these types of studies generally focus on relationships between phenomena or the effect of one phenomenon on another.</p>

        <p>Finally, Chapter 6 examines questions related to theory, either by attempting to develop new theory or to validate existing theory. The field of information and library science is still young in comparison with other disciplines. Thus we are still in the process of developing theories of information behaviors and other phenomena of interest to the field. Two examples illustrating theory development are discussed in this chapter: a study defining a typology of relationships between personal growth and Internet use (<a href="#16" class = "reference">Kari & Savolainen, 2007</a>) and a study developing a model of factors that affect sense making within an organizational context (<a href="#29" class = "reference">Solomon, 1997a</a>, <a href="#30" class = "reference">1997b</a>, <a href="#31" class = "reference">1997c</a>). In addition, a third example is used to illustrate how an existing theory can be validated; in this case, <a href="#10" class = "reference">Fisher et al.'s (2004)</a> concept of <i>information grounds</i> is validated by testing its extension into a new setting.</p>

        <p>In Part 2, we've devoted four chapters to four different kinds of research questions. These are not the only types of research questions that need to be investigated in ILS, nor are the boundaries of these four types clearly defined. They are meant only to demonstrate that the research questions that we might ask are quite diverse and may be inspired by many different sources. In each case, the examples provided can show you how an ILS research question can be successfully formulated.</p>
