                  <p id="__p2">Animals&#x02019; capacities for different forms
                     of learning do not mature simultaneously during ontogenesis
                     but the molecular mechanisms behind the delayed development
                     of specific types of memory are not fully understood.
                     Mollusks are considered to be among the best models to
                     study memory formation at the molecular level. Chromatin
                     remodeling in developmental processes, as well as in
                     long-term memory formation, was recently shown to play a
                     major role. Histone acetylation is a key process in the
                     chromatin remodeling and is regulated through the signaling
                     cascades, for example MAPK/ERK. Previously, we found that
                     MAPK/ERK is a key pathway in the formation of the food
                     aversion reflex in Helix. Pretreatment with upstream ERK
                     kinase inhibitor PD98059 prevented food avoidance learning
                     in adult Helix. In contrast to adult snails, juveniles
                     possess immature plasticity mechanisms of the avoidance
                     reflex until the age of 2&#x02013;3 months while the
                     MAPK/ERK cascade is not activated after aversive learning.
                     In the present study, we focused on the potential MAPK/ERK
                     target - histone H3.</p></div>
               <div id="__sec2" class="sec"><h3>Methodology/Principal
                  Findings</h3>

                  <p id="__p3">Here we found that a significant increase in
                     histone H3 acetylation occurs in adult animals after
                     learning, whereas no corresponding increase was observed in
                     juveniles. The acetylation of histone H3 is regulated by
                     ERK kinase, since the upstream ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059
                     prevented the increase of histone H3 acetylation upon
                     learning. We found that the injection of histone
                     deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB) prior to
                     training led to induction in histone H3 acetylation and
                     significantly ameliorated long-term memory formation in
                     juvenile snails.</p></div>
               <div id="__sec3" class="sec sec-last"><h3>
                  Conclusions/Significance</h3>

                  <p id="__p4">Thus, MAPK/ERK-dependent histone H3 acetylation
                     plays an essential role in the formation of food aversion
                     in Helix. Dysfunction of the MAPK/ERK dependent histone H3
                     acetylation might determine the deficiency of avoidance
                     behavior and long-term plasticity in juvenile animals.
                     Stimulation of histone H3 acetylation in juvenile animals
                     by NaB promoted avoidance plasticity.</p></div>

            <p id="__p5">Despite extensive research on molecular mechanisms of
               formation, consolidation and retention of memory traces in the
               brain, the major phenomena in neurobiology, i.e. learning and
               memory, are poorly understood. It has been shown that long-term
               memory formation is determined by a rearrangement of neuronal
               networks and by an increase in efficiency of synaptic contacts
               between neurons. These processes require modulation of the genome

            <p id="__p11">To investigate the involvement of histones

               acetylation in the adult and juvenile snails CNS (subesophageal

               knowledge, such studies have not been performed before.</p>

            <p id="__p12">We demonstrated a significant MAPK-dependent increase
               of H3 histone acetylation in the subesophageal complex of ganglia
               of adult animals after learning, whereas in juvenile snails under
               the same conditions histone H3 acetylation induction was not
               observed. Moreover, we found that injection of histone
               deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB) prior to training
               elevated the level of histone acetylation and significantly
               impoves the long-term memory formation in the juvenile snails.
               Thus, histone H3 acetylation plays an essential role in food
               aversion formation in <em>Helix</em>. Dysfunction of histone H3
               acetylation through a lack of the expression of certain genes

                  histone H3 acetylation in their CNS; 2) whether the long-term

                  The increase in H3 acetylation of trained animals injected
                  with NaB is significant in comparison to trained animals

               <p id="__p24">Thus, treatment of juvenile snails with HDAC
                  inhibitor sodium butyrate leads to an increase of histone H3
                  acetylation. The increase in H3 acetylation in adult animals
                  and consequent long-term memory formation, prompted us to
                  investigate, whether increase in H3 acetylation by NaB
                  injection will stimulate long-term memory in young snails.</p>

               <p id="__p25">To check our hypothesis, we tested the aversive
                  behavior of juvenile snails that had been pretreated with
                  saline or NaB 1 h prior training. The percentage of aversive
                  responses to conditional stimulus (carrot) was quantified. The
                  reaction was measured 48 h after the training procedure and
                  was considered aversive if the animal avoided the carrot for
                  more than two minutes.</p>

               <p id="__p26">Cross-tabulation tables with 2 sided Fisher&#x02019;s
                  exact test were used for comparison of probabilities of
                  behavior. In the control group of saline injected animals food
                  refusal was found in 3 out of 18 snails (16.7&#x00025;). In
                  the group injected with the HDAC inhibitor NaB food refusal
                  was found in 10 out of 18 animals (55.6&#x00025;). Fisher&#x02019;s
                  exact test yielded p&#x0003c;0.035. It is noteworthy that in
                  the group of adult snails which were not pretreated with NaB
                  before learning, food refusal was demonstrated in 80&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025;
                  of all cases.</p>

            <p id="__p37">Thus serotonin-dependent dysfunction of the MAPK/ERK
               signaling and disturbance of its downstream targets (TFs and
               histones) might result in the impaired expression of genes
               necessary for long-term plasticity and determine the deficiency
               of avoidance behavior plasticity in juvenile animals.</p>

            <p id="__p38">Moreover, we demonstrated that stimulation of
               acetylation processes in juvenile snails might promote long-term

               HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate NaB restored spatial memory in
               mice even after neuronal loss, characterized by memory
               dysfunction. At the same time as the sprouting of dendrites an
               increased number of synapses are induced. Moreover, in aging

               recall after in vivo injection. The mechanisms underlying the

               and need further investigation.</p>

            <p id="__p39">It would seem that the influence of HDAC inhibitors in
               long-term memory formation may be promoted through the
               histone-dependent chromatin remodeling, as well as through the
               activation of unidentified TFs. Some TFs are known to be
               activated through acetylation <a href="#pone.0041828-Spange1"

               In addition, training procedures were long enough in duration to
               affect the MAPK/ERK signaling and downstream TFs activation
               through a positive feedback loop. The lack of serotonin dependent
               MAPK/ERK induction in juvenile animals may be compensated for
               through histone acetylation-dependent activation of growth
               factors expression <a href="#pone.0041828-Yamada1"

               factors activate MAPK/ERK through the tyrosine-kinase receptors.
               These results on both MAPK/ERK dependent TFs activation and
               histone acetylation, which consequently lead to the activation of
               genes expression involved in the long-term memory formation.</p>

            <p id="__p40">We should not exclude the possibility that the
               activation of several genes requires the involvement of different
               signaling pathways in juvenile animals. The increase of
               acetylation can influence their induction as well.</p>

               <p id="__p41">Animals&#x02019; capacities for different forms of
                  learning do not mature simultaneously during ontogenesis but
                  the molecular mechanisms of behind the delayed development of
                  specific types of memory are not fully understood. We found
                  that significantly increased MAPK/ERK -dependent histone H3
                  acetylation occurs in the CNS of adult animals after food
                  aversion learning. In contrast to adult snails, juveniles
                  possess immature plasticity mechanisms of the avoidance reflex
                  and the histone H3 acetylation is not activated after
                  learning. At the same time we show here that stimulation of
                  acetylation by means of NaB in juvenile snails promoted
                  long-term memory formation.</p>

               <p id="__p42">Thus our results suggest that the ERK-dependent
                  histone H3 acetylation plays an essential role in food
                  aversion learning in adult <em>Helix</em>. Dysfunction of
                  ERK-dependent histone H3 acetylation through a lack of the
                  expression of certain genes might determine the deficiency of
                  long-term plasticity of avoidance behavior in juvenile
                  animals. Such immaturity of long-term memory mechanisms can be
                  compensated for by increasing histone acetyltransferase
                  activity and subsequently by the induction of epigenetic
                  changes. Our data supports and extends the idea that the
                  molecular machinery, involved in long-term memory formation,
                  including epigenetic tagging, is an evolutionary conserved
                  phenomenon and can be modulated by chemical molecules.</p>

               <p id="__p43">Experiments were carried out on adult (20&#x02013;25
                  g) and juvenile (2&#x02013;3 months old, 0.5&#x02013;0.9 g)
                  snails <em>Helix lucorum</em>, and did not require ethical
                  approval. For the experiments were used adult snails from the
                  Crimea population, which had been in the active phase not less
                  than 4 weeks and juvenile snails which were raised in
                  laboratory conditions until needed. All animals were kept in
                  terrariums.</p>

               <p id="__p44">Conditioned food aversion reflex was used as a
                  model of learning (conditioned stimulus - a piece of carrot,
                  unconditioned stimulus - electric shock). A similar procedure
                  was used and described in Balaban <a

                          id="__tag_267099214">[17]</a>. A piece of carrot
                  (conditioned stimulus) was placed at a distance of 1 cm from
                  the head of a snail freely moving on a metal plate (serving as
                  one of stimulating electrodes). When a snail began to eat the
                  carrot, another stimulating electrode was manually placed to
                  the snail&#x02019;s head, and unconditioned stimulus (DC, 1&#x02013;5
                  mA, 0.5 s) was applied. If a snail avoided the carrot for 2
                  min, a piece of carrot was placed close to the snail&#x02019;s
                  mouth, and the unconditioned stimulus was applied. All trained
                  snails received equal stimuli. The training procedure
                  consisted of 8 pairs of stimuli applied at 15&#x02013;20 min
                  interval (4 trials per a session, 1 session per day). Animals
                  were deprived of food for 3 days before the training. Na&#x000ef;ve
                  animals were used as a control group. 1 hour after training
                  the snail&#x02019;s CNS (suboesophageal complex of ganglia)
                  was isolated. The subesophageal complex of ganglia contains
                  neurons which participate in organization of avoidance
                  behavior (including sensory, motor and command neurons). It
                  was shown that about 90&#x00025; of neurons in these ganglia
                  respond to a nociceptive stimulation <a

               <p id="__p45">The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (Cell Signaling) was
                  freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a
                  concentration of 20 mM. Then 6 &#x000b5;l of PD98059 or
                  vehicle were injected into the <em>cephalopedal sinus</em> 30
                  min before conditioning. The total volume of adult
                  <em>Helix</em> hemolymph was estimated at 3 ml resulting in an
                  approximate 500-fold dilution of the drug in hemolymph. Thus,
                  final concentration of PD98059 in hemolymph was around 40
                  &#x000b5;M. In previous studies we showed, that PD98059

               <p id="__p46">To induce acetylation, the animals were treated
                  with deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (Sigma). Sodium

                  injected at a dose of 1,2 mg/g of animal weight (0.01 ml).
                  Injections were made into the <em>cephalopedal sinus</em> 1 h
                  prior conditioning. Control animals were injected with saline
                  only. Injections were given on both training days. Animals
                  were tested 48 hours after the learning procedure.</p></div>

                  performed on ice. Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 7,700&#x000d7;<em>g</em>
                  for 5 min (4&#x000b0;C). The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of
                  0.4 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (and was incubated for 30
                  minutes for the histone extraction) and then centrifuged at
                  14,000&#x000d7;<em>g</em> for 10 min (4&#x000b0;C). The
                  supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and proteins were
                  precipitated with the addition of 250 &#x000b5;l of 100&#x00025;
                  trichloroacetic acid containing 4 mg/ml deoxycholic acid
                  (Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> salt, Helicon) for 30 min and then
                  centrifuged at 14,000&#x000d7;<em>g</em> for 30 min (4&#x000b0;C).
                  The supernatant was discarded and the protein pellet was
                  washed with 1 ml of acidified acetone (0.1&#x00025; HCl)
                  followed by 1 ml of acetone for 5 min each. Protein
                  precipitates were collected by centrifugation (14,000&#x000d7;<em>g</em>,
                  5 min, 4&#x000b0;C). This procedure was done 3 times. The
                  resulting purified proteins were resuspended in 10 mM Tris (pH
                  8.0) and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p>

               <p id="__p48">Protein concentration was measured by Bradford
                  assay. Samples (1 &#x000b5;g) were boiled with loading buffer
                  and equal amount of protein was loaded into the 14&#x00025;
                  SDS-PAGE. Protein markers were from Fermentas (Lithiania).
                  Separated proteins were transferred to the nitrocellulose
                  membrane (Schleicher and Schuel). Ponceau S staining was used
                  to check transfer quality. Membranes were incubated in
                  Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) with 0.1&#x00025; Tween 20
                  (TBS-T) containing 5&#x00025; non-fat dry milk for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C
                  to block nonspecific binding. Subsequently blots were
                  incubated with primary Acetylated-H3-Histone antibodies (4&#x000b0;C
                  overnight) and with secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP
                  (horseradish peroxidase) for 1 h. Immunolabeling was detected
                  by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL system (standard
                  protocol and components from &#x000ab;Amersham pharmacia

                  hour in 5&#x00025; nonfat dry milk and incubated with
                  antibodies against total form of histone H3. After exposure of
                  the membranes, films were scanned and the amount of protein

               <p id="__p49">The amount of acetylated histone H3 was calibrated
                  to the amount of total histone H3, the level of which remains

                  polyclonal antibody against Acetylated-H3-histone (Cell
                  Signaling) was used. Polyclonal antibody against total histone

                  Antibodies against Acetylated-H3-histone and total histone H3
                  were diluted 11000 and

               <p id="__p17">A. Increasing of histone H3 acetylation in the
                  subesophageal complex ganglia of the adult snails is
                  associated with activation of ERK-signaling pathway after
                  aversive learning. The amount of acetylated histone H3 was
                  significantly higher after learning (L), compared to control
                  animals (C). The acetylation was blocked with upstream kinase
                  inhibitor PD98059. The ratio of acetylated histone H3 (Ac-H3)
                  to the total H3 (total H3) determined after Western blot
                  analysis was normalized with average ratio of Ac-H3/total H3

               <em>Helix</em>.</strong>

               <p id="__p33">Upon learning there is serotonin (5-HT) - dependent
                  induction of MAPK/ERK pathway and acetylation of downstream
                  target Histone H3 in <em>Helix</em>. In juvenile animals,
                  incapable to form long-term aversive behavior upon learning
                  procedure, there is no MAPK/ERK activation and no histone H3
                  acetylation. These epigenetic changes can be a cause of
                  abnormal transcription crucial for synaptic plasticity and
                  long-term memory formation. Treatment with deacetylase
                  inhibitor NaB induces acetylation and stimulates long-term
                  memory formation in juvenile animals.</p></div>
